Evaluate News with NLP
This project is part of the
[Front End Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011) program by Udacity.
The main goal here is to show how to utilize [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) to bundle assets for development 
and production purposes .

The following topics has been covered:

- Webpack entry point, output and dist folder
- Webpack Loaders, Plugins and Mode
- API calls
- Testing using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/)
- Offline functionality

## Installation
1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. `npm install`
3. `npm run build-prod`
4. `npm start` to start the app

This app runs on localhost:8081, but you can change this in `server.js`

### To use this app for development purposes:
1. `npm run build-dev` to start webpack dev server which runs on localhost:8080
2. Open another terminal and enter `npm start`, so that we can use our express server endpoints.
